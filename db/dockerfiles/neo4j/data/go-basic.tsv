Initiating the assembly of the RNA polymerase III pre-initiation complex by binding to a control sequence in the intragenic region. This allows to recruit TFIIIB to the DNA at a site centered approximately 26 base pairs upstream of the start site of transcription. For tRNA genes, TFIIIC first associates with DNA, and then recruits TFIIIB. For 5S rRNA genes, TFIIIA binds to DNA first, followed by TFIIIC, which then recruits TFIIIB.

GO:0002460	adaptive immune response based on somatic recombination of immune receptors built from immunoglobulin superfamily domains	biological_process	An immune response mediated by lymphocytes expressing specific receptors for antigen produced through a somatic diversification process that includes somatic recombination of germline gene segments encoding immunoglobulin superfamily domains. Recombined receptors for antigen encoded by immunoglobulin superfamily domains include T cell receptors and immunoglobulins (antibodies) produced by B cells. The first encounter with antigen elicits a primary immune response that is slow and not of great magnitude. T and B cells selected by antigen become activated and undergo clonal expansion. A fraction of antigen-reactive T and B cells become memory cells, whereas others differentiate into effector cells. The memory cells generated during the primary response enable a much faster and stronger secondary immune response upon subsequent exposures to the same antigen (immunological memory).

GO:0005786	signal recognition particle, endoplasmic reticulum targeting	cellular_component	A ribonucleoprotein particle of 325 kDa composed of a 7S (300 nucleotide) RNA molecule and a complex of six different polypeptides. This binds both to the N-terminal signal peptide for proteins destined for the endoplasmic reticulum as they emerge from the large ribosomal subunit and also to the ribosome. This binding arrests further translation thereby preventing the proteins from being released into the cytosol. The SRP-ribosome complex then diffuses to the endoplasmic reticulum where it is bound to the signal recognition particle receptor, which allows resumption of protein synthesis and facilitates the passage of the growing polypeptide chain through the translocon. Through a process involving GTP hydrolysis, the SRP-SRP receptor complex dissociates and SRP returns to the cytosol. Of the six polypeptides of SRP the 54 kDa subunit (SRP54) is the central player. It contains an N-terminal GTPase domain and a C-terminal domain that binds directly to the signal peptide and the SRP RNA.

GO:0007417	central nervous system development	biological_process	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the central nervous system over time, from its formation to the mature structure. The central nervous system is the core nervous system that serves an integrating and coordinating function. In vertebrates it consists of the brain and spinal cord. In those invertebrates with a central nervous system it typically consists of a brain, cerebral ganglia and a nerve cord. [GOC:bf, GOC:jid, ISBN:0582227089]	CNS development
GO:0007418	ventral midline development	biological_process	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the ventral midline over time, from its formation to the mature structure. In protostomes (such as insects, snails and worms) as well as deuterostomes (vertebrates), the midline is an embryonic region that functions in patterning of the adjacent nervous tissue. The ventral midline in insects is a cell population extending along the ventral surface of the embryo and is the region from which cells detach to form the ventrally located nerve cords. In vertebrates, the midline is originally located dorsally. During development, it folds inwards and becomes the ventral part of the dorsally located neural tube and is then called the ventral midline, or floor plate. [GOC:bf, GOC:go_curators, PMID:12075342]	
GO:0007419	ventral cord development	biological_process	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the ventral cord over time, from its formation to the mature structure.

GO:0007420	brain development	biological_process	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the brain over time, from its formation to the mature structure.
